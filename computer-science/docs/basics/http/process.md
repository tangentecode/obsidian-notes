# ðŸ”‚ Process

To understand the HTTP process, let's ask ourselves, what actually happens each time a user types a URL into a browser in order to open a new webpage. Well, the most simple answer is:

- The [client](client-server.md), which in this case is our browser, sends a request to the server in which the web page is located
- The server then sends back a response containing the requested webpage to the client.
