# Types

## Common Types

- Most common types are:

| Type    | Description                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bool`  | Represents a Boolean value, either `true` or `false`.                       |
| `char`  | Represents a single character, typically enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `'A'`). |
| `float` | Represents a floating-point number, used for decimal values (e.g., `3.14`). |
| `int`   | Represents an integer, a whole number without a decimal point (e.g., `42`). |
| `long`  | Represents a larger integer type, capable of holding very large numbers.   |
| `string`| Represents a sequence of characters, typically enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"Hello"`). |

## Size of Different Types

- `bool` 1 byte
- `int` 4 bytes
- `long` 8 bytes
- `float` 4 bytes
- `double` 8 bytes
- `char` 1 byte
- `string` ? bytes
