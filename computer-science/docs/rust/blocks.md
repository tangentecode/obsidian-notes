## Explanation

- A block in rust contains a sequence of expressions, enclosed by braces `{}`
- **Value and [[computer-science/docs/rust/types|type]]** **are those of the last expression** in the block
- The last expression doesn't have a semicolon `;` at the end like returning a value from a [[computer-science/docs/rust/functions|function]]
- A [[computer-science/docs/rust/variables|variable]]â€™s scope is limited to the enclosing block.
