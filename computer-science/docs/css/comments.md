# Comments

To add a comment to a CSS stylesheet, use `/*` to start and `*/` to end the comment. The browser ignores anything between these symbols, so you can write notes without changing your styles.

```c
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

You can also write comments that span multiple lines.

```c
/*
This is a multi-line CSS comment.
Use it for longer notes.
*/
```
